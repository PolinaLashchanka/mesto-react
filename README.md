# MESTO_REACT
### My third project created during Ya.Practicum course "WEB developer"
##### The goal of this project was to re-implementat [MESTO](https://github.com/PolinaLashchanka/mesto) using React.
##### This is a single page application, where you can create your own account, post information about yourself and add photos.
##### When you click the button next to the user name, a form for editing information about the user will open.
#### Technological stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Figma
- React
#### Installation:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PolinaLashchanka/mesto-react.git

npm install
npm run start
```
##### Plans for improvement:
